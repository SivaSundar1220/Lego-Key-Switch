A Clicker Fidget with a nfc chip behind it to lead to any website you want.. 
My goal is to give it out to kids with special disablities.. planning on giving it to a school so they can make it lead to their website or student hotline.. 

Use tree supports for the base and normal supports for the switch part when printing.. 

I used Gaetron milky blue switches
